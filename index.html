				<p>I am an International Design Business Management student at Aalto University, with a background in Electronic Engineering. Up until now I have worked on a variety of projects, raging from finding solutions for children’s problems in Uganda, to solving corporate communication challenges and creating branding strategies in Finland. Prior to that, I have been working as a software developer in various companies and start-ups.</p>
				<p>Currently, I am focusing on my Master’s thesis at Aalto and am interested in talking about opportunities for July 2016 onwards.</p>

				<h1>On Ideas</h1>
				<p>At first, it’s clear. Then ambiguity becomes scary. Then the dots appear. The most fascinating thing to me is that every individual has its own way of finding and connecting those dots.</p>
				<p>Pixels, architecture, musical notes and balance sheets – all of the things, that make up our world, have connections to each other, and to us. It just takes some optimism, empathy and persistence, and one will always reach the point of convergence.</p>

				<h1>Igniting a Change</h1>
				<h2>Empowering Ugandan schools to sustain themselves in a clean way</h2>
				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Issues with water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) at Ugandan schools directly affect pupils' dropout rates, which are the root cause of lower education level of the whole region. Furthermore, the local government does not have sufficient funds to keep the schools clean and provide healthy environment for children who attend the classes.  At the same time Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) have realized that old way of bringing material goods to the areas in need only serve short-term goals. In order to make a real change, local people have to be involved in the process.</p>
				<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
				<p>Farming is the number one activity that people of Acholiland take part in to make money and feed their families. During the research, our team has stumbled upon a phenomenon, where local farmers managed to use human feces as a material for fertilizer. At the same time we knew, that most of Ugandan schools faced the issue of latrines filling up and becoming unusable.</p>
				<h3>The Solution</h3>
				<p>We have come up with a self-sustainable ecosystem of business models, where schools solve their problems of sanitation while at the same time receiving valuable goods for doing it. Furthermore, the surrounding communities, officials, farmers and small-medium enterprises are involved without any external influence of SMEs.</p>
				<p>The concept was considered to be a success by UNICEF and is currently being developed further and tested.</p>

				<h1>Clearing the View</h1>
				<h2>Removing obstacles of organizational communication and collaboration</h2>
				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Currently Kemira employees are using two separate internal systems, which overlap in functionality and are not used to their full potential. Regular users are rarely aware of tools the systems provide to make their work easier. In addition, there is a psychological obstacle for desired change towards increased collaboration - people are not used to engage with people outside their own teams.</p>
				<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
				<p>We have been glad that the client has already acknowledged the challenges, and was open to new ways of solving them. Our proposed design-led way of working was accepted and the collaboration was successful.</p>
				<p>At the same time, our research showed that people would like to, and in some cases do, collaborate. Furthermore, Kemira's employees are loyal and very happy with their jobs. </p>
				<h3>The Solution</h3>
				<p>We have designed an effective intranet homepage that combines functionalities of both of the previous internal systems. Our concept is based on requirements and information provided by Kemira as well as our own research including secondary sources, interviews with employees and personal assessment of current systems. The concept page is designed around elements that support receiving and sharing information. Adding social features has been a major aspect of the project. We have also used our research to determine ways that allow employees to proceed from the front-page as easily as possible in order to perform their job both faster and easier. Additionally, a mobile version of the portal concept has been designed to ensure any employee can access this system from anywhere anytime.</p>

				<h1>Design District Helsinki in 2025</h1>
				<h2>Imagining the future of the heart of Helsinki</h2>
				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Design District Helsinki (DDH) is an association in the Punavuori area, bringing together local businesses and artisans of the creative industries. Its main purpose is to make the district and its actors known as the design area and creative hub of Helsinki, thus reinforcing Helsinki’s role as a design city. Physically, the district is located in Punavuori, close to the center of Helsinki, though it doesn’t have any set boundaries. DDH has contacted us to imagine the near future and create one holistic concept for Design District Helsinki in the year 2025.</p>
				<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
				<p>For a period of two weeks 50 Aalto University International Design Business Management students broke into 14 distinct groups and began exploring, analyzing, interviewing, observing, brainstorming, prototyping and creating concepts. As a group we interviewed and surveyed all together 247 members, tourists and locals. Moreover, the sub-teams investigated other design districts, potential partners, potential members and business models to gain more insights. After the ground research, the teams started brainstorming and created 689 ideas in total. By the end of the ideation the best ideas were taken into further development for a coherent concept.</p>
				<h3>The Solution</h3>
				<p>We clustered our findings and solutions into four main areas: collaboration, financing, identity and desirability. These areas form a strategy on how to transform the District into a vibrant, globally recognized authority and destination for design. The development of the strategy for DDH took the class a total of two weeks to accomplish. The final results were showcased in an exhibition at Päivälehden Museo. The overall concept has been presented to the Board of DDH, where it was evaluated as successful and put into the execution plan.</p>

				<h1>Fermata</h1>
				<p>Fermata is a software-hardware product concept with the aim to solve the security issue of musical instruments. Little is known that classical instruments are valued in thousands of dollars, which attract various groups of organized crime to participate in their theft in large quantities.</p>
				<p>A Bluetooth device is attached to the case on an instrument, while mobile app informs the user about various parameters of the instrument, for example humidity factors or instrument’s geographic location, thus helping it’s owner to be more sure of instrument’s condition during the practice or travel.</p>
